Banner self-service Base Image
==============================

This is used to build a base image for running Banner XE self-service, but isn't
especially useful by itself.

All changes to JAVA_OPTS and and CATALINA_OPTS should be appended rather than replaced
to.

Note: This hasn't been used in production (yet), but appears to work in testing.
